# Node.js Adventure ðŸš€  

Welcome to my Node.js lab! âš¡  
This repository is where I experiment, break things (on purpose ðŸ˜‰), and piece together projects as I learn the magic of Node.js â€“ starting from simple scripts and moving into full-blown applications.  

The idea behind this repo is to keep a living record of my growth, sharpen my problem-solving skills, and get comfortable with writing clean, scalable, and efficient backend code.  

Iâ€™ll keep adding new code snippets, mini-projects, and bigger builds as I push deeper into Node.js â€“ from the basics of modules and events, all the way up to APIs, databases, and real-world projects.

### ðŸŽ¯ What This Repo Is For  
- Logging my Node.js learning journey step by step.  
- Practicing by actually building stuff (not just reading docs).  
- Creating a go-to reference I (and maybe you) can revisit later.
